### What is MongoDB? 
MongoDB is a NoSQL Database which stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON 
It is not a traditional relational database like PostreSQL that stores data in tables with rows, 
MongoDB stores collections of documents
MongoDB is schema-less which means we donâ€™t have to pre-define the fields that will exist
It is ideal for our application

### Visualising data in our MongoDB 
We can use noSQL booster to visualise data locally produced 
Go to the official website: https://nosqlbooster.com/downloads 
Choose your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Download the installer
Click "New Connection" or "Connect" on the main screen.
Fill in the connection details:
Connection Name: (any name you want, e.g., "Local MongoDB")
Server Address: localhost
Port: 27017 (default MongoDB port)
If your MongoDB instance requires authentication, enter your Username and Password.
If using a cloud MongoDB provider (like Atlas), enter the connection string URI from your provider.
Test the connection by clicking the "Test" button.
If the test is successful, click "Connect" to open the connection.
