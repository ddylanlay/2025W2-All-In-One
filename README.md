A web-app to optimise the renting process between tenants/landlord and agents.

PropManager is a web application for desktop use. The site is used regularly by Agents (Property Managers), Rental Tenants and occasionally by Landlords.

PropManagerâ€™s primary purpose is to make the process of renting properties a seamless, and even, enjoyable process, for all parties involved. There is a strong need for intuitive design, given the nature of our users' lifestyles - busy and driven by a desire for simplicity.

PropManager users will rely on our website to be fast, clear and accessible.
Our primary user, agents, rely on PropManager as a tool to combine many aspects of the rental process. Firstly, they use it to find potential tenants for the properties they list. Secondly, they rely on the tasks, notifications and booking systems to schedule annual inspections, viewings. Finally, they benefit from advanced tools such as route planning, messaging and task management to speed up their daily tasks.

Tenants use PropManager to not only seek future rental accommodation, but manage their existing rental arrangements. For instance, reviewing and updating their rental agreement contracts, pricing changes and upcoming annual inspections.
Finally, landlords rely on the app to help them select a desired rental tenant, in conjunction with their agent, and view the incoming fees from their tenants.
